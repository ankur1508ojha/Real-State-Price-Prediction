In this project we will predict the sale prices of homes in KingCounty, USA, between May 2014 and May 2015
# By using deep learning techniques and several relevant features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms,
# view, and square footage, this project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate home prices in King County.
# Such a model can be used by real estate agents, buyers, and sellers to make more informed decisions about home pricing, purchase, and sale.


We will do following Steps:>

# # TRAIN A DEEP LEARNING MODEL WITH LIMITED NUMBER OF FEATURES
## once the model is trained(using train_set) we freeze those weights between the neurons
# and access the performance of network on completey new data set that model has not seen(test_set)
# this is the idea we make sure that thiss deep neural network  are able 
# to generalize not memorize the traning data

# EVALUATE TRAINED DEEP LEARNING MODEL PERFORMANCE 
#. TRAIN AND EVALUATE A DEEP LEARNING MODEL WITH INCREASED 
# NUMBER OF FEATURES (INDEPENDANT VARIABLES)
